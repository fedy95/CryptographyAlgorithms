Encryption/decryption with using cryptography algorithms

Already was realized ElGamal.
Elgamal encryption system is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm for public-key cryptography which is based on the Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange.

Elgamal encryption consists of three components: 
 1) the keys generator (public and private keys);
 2) the encryption algorithm;
 3) the decryption algorithm.

RSA:
 1) the keys generator (public and private keys);
